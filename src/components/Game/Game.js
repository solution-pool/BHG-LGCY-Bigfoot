          You are a Bigfoot-CRYPTOid, walking through the forest. As you wander,
          you will need to eat plants, mushrooms, small animals, maybe an
          occasional deer to build and maintain <b>Strength.</b> You will also
          need to collect rocks and branches to be used for various challenges and as <b>Ammo</b> in your
          battles against the Backwoods Hunters.
          <br />
          <br />
          You will encounter <b>Challenges</b> which can earn you rewards –
          points, prizes, tokens – or advancement in the game.  You may find some <b>Random Treasures</b> along the way, but you must
          also avoid <b>Random Dangers.</b>
          <br />
          <br />
          Your Objective: Find the Backwoods Hunters and destroy them. It’s a
          battle to the death to ensure no one reveals our existence.
          <br />
          <br />
          We’ve also taken over the <b>Ranger Station</b>, so feel free to come in and socialize.
