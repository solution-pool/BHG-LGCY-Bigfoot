          Being fully aware of the impact cryptocurrency and related projects
          have on the environment, Bigfoot CRYPTOids is committed to offsetting
          our carbon footprint. <br />
          <br />
          Our first step toward this goal is to team with OneTreePlanted.org â€“ a
          non-profit organization is committed to global reforestation. For
          every project NFT, we are going to plant a tree!
          <br />
          <br />
          Our second step toward this goal will be announced as soon as the
          details have been finalized. Stay tuned.
